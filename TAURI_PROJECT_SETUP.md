# Tauri Project Setup Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the setup and configuration of the Cushion Desktop Tauri application.

## Project Structure
The project has been initialized as a Tauri application with the following key components:

### Frontend (src/)
- `index.html` - Main HTML entry point
- `main.js` - JavaScript application logic
- `styles.css` - Application styling
- `assets/` - Static assets including Tauri and JavaScript logos

### Backend (src-tauri/)
- `src/main.rs` - Rust main entry point
- `src/lib.rs` - Rust library code
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies and configuration
- `tauri.conf.json` - Tauri application configuration
- `icons/` - Application icons for various platforms
- `capabilities/default.json` - Tauri capabilities configuration

### Platform-Specific Generated Files
- `gen/apple/` - iOS/macOS specific generated files including:
  - Xcode project configuration
  - App icons and launch screens
  - Platform-specific entitlements and info plists

## Key Configuration Files

### package.json
Contains Node.js dependencies and scripts for the frontend portion of the application.

### Cargo.toml
Defines Rust dependencies including:
- `tauri` - Core Tauri framework
- `serde` - Serialization framework

### tauri.conf.json
Main Tauri configuration including:
- Application metadata (name: "cushion-desktop")
- Bundle configuration
- Security and capability settings
- Build configuration

## Git Repository
- Initialized git repository with initial commit
- Created `tauri-test` branch for development
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` files for both Node.js and Rust artifacts

## Changes Made
1. **Repository Initialization**: Set up git repository with all project files
2. **Branch Creation**: Created `tauri-test` branch for development work
3. **Project Structure**: Established complete Tauri project structure with both frontend and backend components
4. **Platform Support**: Generated platform-specific files for iOS/macOS deployment
5. **Development Environment**: Configured VS Code extensions and development settings

## Next Steps
This project is now ready for:
- Frontend development using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Backend Rust development for native functionality
- Cross-platform desktop application building
- Mobile app development (iOS support already configured)
